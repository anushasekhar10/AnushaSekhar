I hope reading content from here gives each one of you something to learn and implement!

**Project1 #VBA Challenge**

**Prerequisites**

1.Excel with Devloper Tools option enabled

2.Sample datasets of similar layout that can be used to run the vbs code on 

3.Most important of all some Dedication to Learn with an open mind! 

**Installations**

1.Microsoft Excel (Easily available for download from the Microsoft Website) 

**How to execute?**

Step 1.Open an Excel file with Data that has similar layout from (Column A to G) as then Screenshot you will find in the reposiotry with name : Multiple_year_stock_data.jpg

  Option 2 :Macros-->Select Macro name --> Stock_Program -->Run 

Step 3.Post Execution you should see data similar to screensot with name : Screenshot_2018_Results.jpg

Note : This code will run for all the worksheets that are present in the data file. In the file that this code was tested on there was data in three worksheets for 2018, 2019 and 2020.
